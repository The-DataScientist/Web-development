	<h1>Projects :</h1>
	<p>There is adoption across all industries and across all types of businesses. There is no typical business: all business sectors generate data. Distribution, industry, financial sector, services ... all companies have data from website, mobile applications, internal databases, partner information, ect. Data is the raw material for machine learning, so the opportunities are great, including in the more traditional sectors, such as industry, which uses data from sensors and machines.</p>

	<h1>What are the main uses?</h1>
	<p>In finance, for example, data and prediction have always been at the heart of the activity. On these sectors, the use case is very clear with an immediate ROI if we manage to predict correctly. E-commerce, with all its data from the web and mobile, has also sorted out the subject, but today we are witnessing a generalization to all sectors. The use cases are sometimes simple but are useful to the company, which can thus predict its supply needs or operational metrics. All companies have dashboards on which to get predictions would be useful. All of these planning activities can be optimized by machine learning.</p>

	<h1>Data analysis and help support decision making:</h1>
	<p>* Data analysis is a set of mathematical methods which make it possible to process "items" in a table. these items are described by a set of variables. <br> * The objective of data analysis is to process information such as: what are the identical or dissimilar items, what are the relationships between the items and the associated variables . <br> * Most often the results of these analyzes make it possible to adjust and optimize the commercial policies or strategies of companies. </p>
